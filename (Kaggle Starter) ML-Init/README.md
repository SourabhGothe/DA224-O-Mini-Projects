This folder contains the work for Course Project done for DA203-O: ICAIML

## Presentation

Presentation is available in IEEE format : ML_Init_CourseProjectReport.pdf

## Approach

ML Init creates an easy to use one of a kind GUI to provide great user experience. It consists of Data cleaning, Data preparation, Statistical and correlation analysis, Visualization, Stratification and a flavour of ML modeling. Following are the goals and motivations of the proposed solution.

• Create an easy to use GUI Interface to input the data, label and for customizing data visualizations
• Provide automatic and user-driven insights.
• Provide statistical and correlational analysis of data with
findings/insights.
• Prepare data with various methods of imputation like mean, median, mode, ffill, bfill, KNN regressor.
• Perform data type conversions for time, categorical data types
• Stunning visualizations of data based on target and corrrelation analysis
• Data split based on stratification(feature selection for stratification with least error)
